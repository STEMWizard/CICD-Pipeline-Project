        <h1>Continuous Integration / Continuous development</h1>
        <h2>What is CI/CD?</h2>
        <p>CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment. It's a set of practices and principles used in software development to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.</p>

            <h3>Continuous integration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Involves frequent merging of code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository.</li>
                <li>Each integration triggers automated builds and tests to detect errors early in the development cycle.</li>
                <li>This helps to ensure that the codebase is always in a working state and reduces the risk of conflicts or integration issues.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-group" id="two">  
            <h3>Continuous delivery</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Takes CI a step further by automating the release process.</li>
                <li>Code changes that pass the automated tests are automatically prepared for deployment to production environments.</li>
                <li>This allows teams to release new features and updates more frequently and reliably. </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph-group" id="three">
            <h3>Continuous deployment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Goes beyond continuous delivery by automatically deploying code changes to production environments.</li>
                <li>This means that every change that passes the automated tests is immediately available to users.</li>
                <li>This approach requires a high degree of confidence in the automated tests and a mature DevOps culture.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why is CI/CD important?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Accelerates software delivery: By automating manual tasks and streamlining the development process, CI/CD enables teams to release software updates more frequently and quickly.</li>
                <li>Improves software quality: Automated tests help to identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle, leading to more reliable and robust software.</li>
                <li>Reduces risk: By automating the release process, CI/CD reduces the risk of human error and ensures that deployments are consistent and predictable.</li>
                <li>Enhances collaboration: CI/CD encourages closer collaboration between development, operations, and testing teams, leading to a more efficient and effective software development process.</li>
